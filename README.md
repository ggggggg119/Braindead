Programming is basically bossing around a computer by screaming in its face with ultra-specific, nitpicky instructions written in its weird little robot languages, so it doesn't have a meltdown and yeet itself into the void. You're like, "Yo, make this thingy do the thing," but the computer's all, "What thing? How thing? Where thing?" So you gotta hand-hold this dumb silicon baby and explain everything step-by-step, like you're teaching a goldfish how to do taxes. And when it finally works, you feel like a wizard who just summoned a digital pet rock into obedience.
