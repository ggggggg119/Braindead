Programming is basically bossing around a computer by screaming in its face with ultra specific, brain rotting instructions written in its weird and dumb little robot languages, so it doesn't have a meltdown and yeet itself into the void because you forgot to tell them how to walk straight. You're like, "Yo, make this thingy do the thing," but the computer's all, "What thing? How thing? Where thing?" So you gotta hand hold this dumb silicon baby and explain everything step by step until you develop brain aneurysm, like you're teaching a goldfish how to do your taxes. And when it finally works, you feel like a wizard who just summoned a digital pet rock into obedience. people think most programmer know what theyre doing, but trust me,our brain explode into million pieces if you ask us how to center a div
